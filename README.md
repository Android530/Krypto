# Krypto - Multimedia Content Protection System

## Project Statement

Multimedia information like text, audio, video and any combination of those are most pervasive in
almost every application fields namely Computer, Network, Smartphone and elsewhere. We also
require a high degree of privacies of our own document. There is a problem that how such a document
can be protected from unauthorized access. Of course, there are many methods such as using password,
smart card, biometrics, etc. are known. Nevertheless, the existing methods have their own limitations as
robustness and cost issues. This project would aim to devise a (new) method and develop a user
friendly and cost effective solution to the problem.

### Input
- A detail profile of the user, who wish to protect the document. The profile template will be finalized after a careful discussion with the team member (i.e., software engineer here).
- If any other input that might require.
- Document itself to be protected

### Functions
- Encryption of document
- Decryption of document
- Opening a document under protection
- Deleting a document under protection
- Copying a document under protection

### Output
- Document after encryption
- Document after decryption
- Result on opening a document: success or failure; locking for three unsuccessful attempts
- Results on deleting a document under protection: success or failure; locking for three unsuccessful attempts
- Results on copying a document under protection: success or failure; locking for three
unsuccessful attempts
